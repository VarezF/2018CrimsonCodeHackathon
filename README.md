# As a part of the 2018 Crimsoncode Hackathon, StudentLife was created to provide college freshman an easy way to get connected with their campus. The code focuses on WSU and WU campuses in Washington and includes information on how to get connected to clubs, events, and more. The final goal of the project is to make an easy to use reference for college freshman who need help getting to know their campus.
